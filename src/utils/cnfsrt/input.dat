#------- input data --------
# RdmpFile : input file, the user just need to provide the x,y,z coordinates of
#            the beads ordered from 1 - nseg+1 line by line
# nchain : number of chains
# nseg : number of segments
# nseg_bb : number of segments in the backbone
# qmax : the maximum extensibility of a segments (important if the beads have overlap)
# traj_idx : index of the chain that is desired to keep track of
# npixel: number of pixels (brightness resolution points) in a unit length
# bin_sz: number of pixels in a bin, used for averaging brightness
# min_dmp_fr: min and max fraction of total number of dumps
#             to use for evaluating the average configuration
# bead_overlap: if the beads have overlap, useful for bead-spring model
