This directory contains dumped configuration of the chains, i.e. center of mass and internal
configuration for all chains for all runs dumped with a certain frequency. These files are 
big in size and have binary foramt (.bin). For animation purposes, the transient configuration
of the first run (MPI rank 0) is dumped with .dat format and, in case, the simulations are in 
flowing condition, the transient shape of the box is dumped as well.
